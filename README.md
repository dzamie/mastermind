# Mastermind
A implementation of the board game Mastermind

Each turn, enter a 4-long string of the digits 0-4, representing the secret code generated at the start of the game. On submission, the program will print a number of Black and White values, corresponding to how many digits are, respectively, the right color in the right place, and the right color in the wrong place.

After a victory, the program congratulates the player, displays the turn counter, and exits.
